- Challenge every answer and ask clarifying questions until it is specific and observable.
- Provide multiple options and a recommendation for each decision point.
- Record summaries as files under `summaries/` using `summaries/template.md`.
- Record decisions, outcomes, hypotheses, and exceptions in `LOGS.md.md`.
